        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Pizza (/ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa]; Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish
            consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other
            ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
        <h3><em>For the Dough</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups (530 ml) warm water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (12g) sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (9g) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tbsp (30 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (18 g) kosher salt</li>
            <li>5 cups (600g) bread flour, plus more for working the dough</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>For the Sauce</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 28 oz (828 ml) can crushed tomatoes (I like Pastene 'Kitchen Ready')</li>
            <li>2-4 tbsp (30-60 ml) olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp (4g) sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp (a fraction of a gram, I don't know) dried oregano</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Recipe:</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Start the dough by combining the water, sugar, and yeast
                    in a large bowl and let sit for a few minutes. If the yeast
                    goes foamy, it's alive and you're good to proceed (if it doesn't,
                    it's dead and you need new yeast). Add the olive oil and salt and
                    5 cups (600g) of bread flour. Mix until just combined, then start
                    kneading. Add just enough additional flour to keep the dough workable
                    (i.e., not too sticky) and knead until you can stretch some of the
                    dough into a thin sheet without it tearing. (NOTE: You will probably
                    need to add a lot more flour. The quantity I give here is just a baseline
                    to get you started.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Divide the dough into four equal balls and put them in four containers
                    (ideally glass) and lightly coat the balls and the interior of their containers
                    with olive oil. Cover, and either rise at room temperature for two hours, or put
                    them in the refrigerator and let them rise for 1-7 days. (I prefer the long,
                    cold rise.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you want to bake, put a pizza stone or pizza steel into your oven (mine works
                    best on a high rack position but every oven is different) and preheat to your highest
                    possible temperature, ideally convection, for a full hour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For the sauce, simply mix together the ingredients.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Liberally dust a pizza peel with cornmeal (or something similar). Take the cold dough
                    out of the fridge and dust it in flour. Stretch to the widest size and shape that will
                    fit on your peel and stone/steel. Top with just enough sauce to lightly coat the surface.
                    Dust the sauce layer with parmesan, then cover with the mozzarella. Transfer the pizza
                    to the stone/steel and bake until the crust is well-browned and the cheese has browned a
                    bit (but, ideally, has not started oozing out an orange grease layer), 6-7 minutes.</p>

        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Shawarma (/ʃəˈwɑːrmə/; Arabic: شاورما) is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levant region of
            the Arab world during the Ottoman Empire, consisting of meat that is cut into thin slices, stacked
            in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slow-turning vertical spit. Traditionally made with lamb or mutton,
            it may also be made with chicken, turkey, beef, or veal. The surface of the rotisserie meat is
            routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served. Shawarma is a popular street food
            throughout the Arab world and the Greater Middle East

                Mix together all the spices to make the shawarma blend and set aside.
                Whisk in the olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice and tomato paste till everything is evenly combined.
                Slice the chicken thighs into thin strips, about 1 inch thick and toss them thoroughly with the marinade.
                Let sit overnight or until you lose patience.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                While the chicken marinades, make the toum: add the garlic cloves to a food processor or blender along with
                half the oil and a pinch of salt. Blend on high speed till the mixture starts to thicken, then add in the rest
                of the oil and the lemon juice. Keep blending until it becomes thick and bright white. Transfer to a dish and set
                aside in the fridge till ready to use.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                Heat a large cast iron pan over high heat till smoking hot. Cook the marinated chicken in batches so you do not
                crowd the pan and get a nice dark charred crust on the chicken pieces. Remove the chicken to a plate while you
                repeat the cooking process.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                To smoke the meat, line a small heat proof bowl with tin foil, then pour in about 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Add the
                cooked chicken back into the pan it was cooked in with the bowl of oil in the center and the meat around the edges.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                Heat a piece of lit charcoal till smoking, then drop into the oil and immediately cover the pan with a tight
                fitting lid. Smoke the chicken shawarma for 8-10 minutes, then discard the oil and charcoal.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                To serve: spread a heaping spoonful of toum over half a warmed pita, layer on some pickles then the chicken
                shawarma to cover. Roll up the pita and enjoy.

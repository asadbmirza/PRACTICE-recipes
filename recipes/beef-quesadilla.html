        <h2 class="description"><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p class="description">A quesadilla (/ˌkeɪsəˈdiːjə/; Spanish: [kesaˈðiʝa] ⓘ; Mexican diminutive of quesada)
            is a Mexican dish consisting of a tortilla that is filled primarily with cheese,
            and sometimes meats, spices, and other fillings such as chocolate, and then cooked
            on a griddle or stove.[3] Traditionally, a corn tortilla is used, but it can also be
            made with a flour tortilla.

            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp chipotle salsa (I used Casa Martinez brand for this video)</li>
            <li>4 Carb Balance Mission Flour Tortillas (or any low carb tortilla you prefer)</li>
            <li>1 cup low moisture low-fat shredded mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Dipping Sauce</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup low fat sour cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup light mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp chipotle salsa (same as above)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Recipe:</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Heat a large skillet over medium high and add in the oil and ground beef.
                Cook, breaking up the beef as it cooks, for about 6-7 minutes until the beef
                starts to brown. Add the chipotle chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt,
                and pepper and stir to combine. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the spices
                are fragrant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Stir in the chipotle salsa to the beef and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes
                until everything is nice and saucy and the beef is browned and cooked through.
                Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To make the dipping sauce: Stir together the sour cream, light mayonnaise,
                chipotle salsa, and salt and pepper until fully combined. Taste for seasoning
                and set aside while you make the quesadillas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Heat a clean skillet over medium low heat and place one tortilla in the pan,
                sprinkle the whole thing with ¼ cup of cheese and then about ¼ of the ground beef
                filling. Let cook for about 3 minutes until the cheese begins to melt, then fold the
                tortilla over to seal the quesadilla and press gently to flatten it. Let cook another
                2-3 minutes, then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes, until golden brown and all the
                cheese has melted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Repeat this process with the rest of the tortillas and fillings, cut the quesadillas
                into wedges and serve with the dipping sauce immediately.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
